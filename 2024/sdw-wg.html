      <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>

      <p> Increasing numbers of Web applications provide a means of accessing
      data. From simple visualisations to sophisticated interactive tools, there
      is a growing reliance on data. The open data movement has led to many
      national, regional and local governments to publish their data on the Web.
      Scientific and cultural heritage data is likewise increasingly published
      this way for reuse by others. Crowd-sourced and social media data are too
      abundant on the Web. Sensors, connected devices and services from domains
      such as energy, transport, manufacturing and healthcare are becoming
      commonly integrated using the Web as a common data sharing platform.

      <p> The Spatial Data on the Web Working Group (SDWWG) is concerned with
      spatial data:
      data that describes anything with spatial extent (i.e. size,
      shape or position). Spatial data is
      also known as location information. The SDWWG acknowledges lingering
      challenges with the provision of spatial data
      identified in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/">Data on the Web
      Best Practices</a> (DWBP) document. The SDWWG thus commits to realise the
      full potential of the Web as a data sharing platform, developing, promoting
      and maintaining resources enabling the consistent and inter-linked
      provision of spatial data.

      <p> Spatial data are in fact abundant on the Web; the maps and street level
      images offered by search engines, vast collections of Earth Observation
      products provided by government agencies, the results of Research projects
      on a myriad of domains, spatial features published by commercial companies
      seeking to expand user and client engagement. These are but a few examples
      of a growing universe of spatial data available on the Web. However, these
      are often difficult to find and problematic to access for non-specialist
      users. The key problems are discoverability, accessibility, and
      interoperability. The overarching goal of the SDWWG is to enable spatial
      data to be integrated within the wider Web of data; developing and
      maintaining standard patterns and specifications addressing these
      problems.

      <p>Updated document status is available on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/sdw/publications">group
          publication status page</a>.

      <p><i>Draft state</i> indicates the state of the deliverable
        at the time of the charter approval. <i>Expected
          completion</i> indicates when the deliverable is projected
        to become a Recommendation, or otherwise reach a stable
        state.

      <section id=normative>
        <h3>Normative Specifications</h3>

        <p>The Working Group will deliver the following W3C
          normative specifications:

        <ul>
          <li class=spec id=6379> <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/" rel=versionof>Semantic Sensor Network
              Ontology</a> - new edition of core and extension parts.
            <ul>
              <li class=draft-status>Draft state: Adopted (core)

              <li class=milestone>Expected completion: Q4 2024 (core)

              <li>OGC SWG: <a href="https://portal.ogc.org/?m=projects&a=view&project_id=292">Observations, Measurements, and Samples SWG</a>

              <li>Latest publication: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/REC-vocab-ssn-20171019/">2017-10-19</a>

              <li>Abstract:
                <p>The Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology is an
                  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/"
		  ><abbr title="RDF Schema"
		  >RDFS</abbr></a>/<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/"
		  ><abbr title="Web Ontology Language"
		  >OWL</abbr></a> ontology for describing observations made
                  by sensors implementing specified procedures, the
                  studied features of interest and the observed
                  properties, along with samples used in the
                  observations and the sampling activities that
                  created them, as well as actuations which follow a
                  similar semantics and data structure.

                <p>The SOSA vocabulary (Sensors, Observations,
                  Samples and Actuations) contains the core terms and
                  definitions from SSN, packaged for use in general
                  applications.

                <p>Additional parts of this ontology will be published as separate recommendations.
                At time of charter these are expected to include:
                <ul>
                  <li>ObservableProperties model</li>
                  <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/"
		  >JSON-LD</a> binding for OGC API Features JSON</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Alignments with some related ontologies and data
                  models are included in the recommendation.
            </ul>

	<li class=spec id=6379>GeoDCAT - a geospatial profile of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/" rel=versionof>DCAT vocabulary</a>.

              <li>OGC SWG: <a href="https://portal.ogc.org/?m=projects&a=view&project_id=713">GeoDCAT SWG</a>

              <li>Abstract:
                <p>GeoDCAT will be a spatio-temporal profile of the W3C DCAT Recommendation [DCAT] , and provide guidance about its use and further specialization.

                <p>Additional profiles further specialising GeoDCAT may be published as separate recommendations.
            </ul>

                <li>Abstract:
                  <p>GeoSPARQL contains a small spatial domain OWL ontology that allow literal representations of
                    geometries to be associated with spatial features and for features to be associated with other
                    features using spatial relations.</p>

                  <p>GeoSPARQL also contains SPARQL extension function definitions that can be used to calculate
                    relations between spatial objects.</p>

                  <p>Several other supporting assets are also contained within GeoSPARQL such as vocabularies of
                    Simple Feature types and data validators.</p>

      <h2>Success Criteria</h2>
      <!-- Testing and interop -->
      <p>In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsPR"
          title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each normative specification is expected to have
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent
          interoperable implementations</a>
        of every feature defined in the specification, where
        interoperability can be verified by passing open test suites,
        and two or more implementations interoperating with each
        other.

      <p>There should be testing plans for each specification,
        starting from the earliest drafts.

      <p>To promote interoperability, all
        changes made to specifications in Candidate Recommendation or
        to features that have deployed implementations should have <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html">tests</a>. Testing efforts should be conducted via the
        <a href="https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt">Web
          Platform Tests</a> project.
      </p>
      <!-- Horizontal review -->
      <p>Each specification should contain sections detailing all
        known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web
        authors, and end users.

      <p>Where appropriate, specifications should contain a section on
        accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts,
        including ways specification features can be used to address
        them, and recommendations for maximising accessibility in
        implementations.</p>
      <!-- Design principles -->
      <p>This Working Group expects to follow the TAG <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/">Web Platform
          Design Principles</a>.</p>
      <!-- Relevance and momentum -->
      <!-- 
        <p><span class=todo>Consider adding this clause if the Group
          does not intend to move to REC:</span> All new features
        should have expressions of interest from at least two
        potential implementors before being incorporated in the
        specification.
        -->
    </section>

    <section id=coordination>
      <h2>Coordination</h2>

      <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for
        accessibility,
        internationalization, privacy, and security with the relevant
        Working and Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/"
          title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>. Invitation
        for review must be issued during each major standards-track
        document transition, including <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsWD"
          title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>. The Working
        Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the
        horizontal review groups throughout development of each
        specification. The Working Group is advised to seek a review
        at least 3 months before first entering <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsCR"
          title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged
        to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major
        changes occur in a specification following a review.

      <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups
        will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#WGCharter">W3C
          Process Document</a>:

        <h3 id=ogc-coordination>OGC Groups</h3>

        <p>Most working groups operating at OGC have a scope that
          may intersect with topics of interest discussed in the
          Spatial Data on the Web Working Group. The OGC Architecture
          Board (OAB), comparable to the W3C Technical Advisory Group
          (TAG) will provide high level guidance to the Spatial Data
          on the Web Working Group. The Working Group expects to
          liaise with OGC groups as needed, and more specifically
          with:

      <h2 id=participation> Participation</h2>

      <p>To be successful, this Working) Group is expected to have 6
        or more active participants for its duration, including
        representatives from the key implementors of this
        specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each
        specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test
        Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per
        week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum
        requirement for other Participants.

      <p>The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its
        public mailing lists and document repositories, as described
        in <a href="#communication">Communication</a>.

      <p>The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical
        submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the
        terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/patent-policy/">W3C
          Patent Policy</a>.

      <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the W3C <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/policies/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>.
    </section>

    <section id=communication>
      <h2> Communication</h2>

      <p id=public> Technical discussions for this Working Group are
        conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting
        minutes from teleconference and
        face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and
        technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in
        a manner that can be both read and written to by the general
        public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications
        will be developed in public repositories and may permit
        direct public contribution requests. The meetings themselves
        are not open to public participation, however.

      <p>Information about the group (including details about
        deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and
        meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/sdw/">Spatial Data on the Web
          Working Group home page.</a>

      <p>Most Spatial Data on the Web Working Group teleconferences
        will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and
        will be conducted on an as-needed basis.

      <p>This group primarily conducts its technical work on the
        public mailing list <a class=todo href="mailto:public-sdw-wg@w3.org" id=public-name>public-sdw-wg@w3.org</a> (<a
          class=todo href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-sdw-wg/">archive</a>) and on <a
          class=todo href="https://github.com/w3c/sdw/issues" id=public-github>GitHub issues</a>. The public is invited
        to review, discuss
        and contribute to this work.

      <p>The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for
        administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs
        and members of the group, for member-only discussions in
        special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.
    </section>

    <section id=decisions>
      <h2> Decision Policy</h2>

      <p> This group will seek to make decisions through consensus
        and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Consensus">W3C
          Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. Typically,
        an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal,
        which is then refined in discussion with members of the group
        and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal
        voting being required.

      <p> However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress
        and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of
        the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group
        vote and record a decision along with any objections.

      <p> To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational
        deliberation, any resolution (including publication
        decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference
        will be considered provisional. A call for consensus (CfC)
        will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email,
        GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period
        from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's
        evaluation of the group consensus on the issue. If no
        objections are raised by the end of the response period, the
        resolution will be considered to have consensus as a
        resolution of the Working Group.

      <p>All decisions made by the group should be considered
        resolved unless and until new information becomes available
        or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs.

      <p>This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Votes">W3C
          Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and
        includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process
        Document requires.
